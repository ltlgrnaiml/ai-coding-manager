### User Input

Can you please make sure the AI Coding Manager name is thoroughly implemented as the long form name for AICM and that we make sure our existing (non-archived) documentation is fully aligned where needed this is very important to get correct right from the very start.

The lint warnings are pre-existing formatting issues in the files, not caused by my naming edits. I'll proceed with the naming consistency task.

### Planner Response

## Summary: AI Coding Manager Naming Consistency

Successfully updated **8 non-archived documentation files** to ensure "AI Coding Manager" is consistently used as the long-form name for AICM.

### Files Updated

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `@/Users/kalepook_ai/Coding/ai-coding-manager/VISION.md:1` | Title → "AI Coding Manager (AICM) Vision Statement" |
| `@/Users/kalepook_ai/Coding/ai-coding-manager/TODO.md:1` | Title → "AI Coding Manager (AICM)" (was "AI Dev Orchestrator") |
| `@/Users/kalepook_ai/Coding/ai-coding-manager/.search_prompts/README.md:1` | Expanded AICM in title |
| `@/Users/kalepook_ai/Coding/ai-coding-manager/.discussions/README.md:3` | Added "Part of: AI Coding Manager (AICM)" |
| `@/Users/kalepook_ai/Coding/ai-coding-manager/.adrs/README.md:3` | Added "Part of: AI Coding Manager (AICM)" |
| `@/Users/kalepook_ai/Coding/ai-coding-manager/.sessions/README.md:3` | Added "Part of: AI Coding Manager (AICM)" |
| `@/Users/kalepook_ai/Coding/ai-coding-manager/.questions/README.md:3` | Added "Part of: AI Coding Manager (AICM)" |

### Already Correct (No Changes Needed)

- `@/Users/kalepook_ai/Coding/ai-coding-manager/README.md:1` — "# AI Coding Manager (AICM)" ✓
- `@/Users/kalepook_ai/Coding/ai-coding-manager/CONTRIBUTING.md:1` — "# Contributing to AI Coding Manager" ✓
- `@/Users/kalepook_ai/Coding/ai-coding-manager/.chat_logs/README.md:99` — "Part of the AI Coding Manager (AICM) project" ✓
- All DISC files (0001-0009) properly use the naming convention ✓

### Naming Convention Established

- **First reference**: "AI Coding Manager (AICM)"
- **Subsequent references**: "AICM" is acceptable
- **Artifact directories**: All READMEs now include "Part of: AI Coding Manager (AICM)"

*Viewed [DISC-0002_AICM-Product-Definition.md](file:///Users/kalepook_ai/Coding/ai-coding-manager/.discussions/DISC-0002_AICM-Product-Definition.md) *

### User Input

"Methodology-as-Software"  I like this but want you to fully re-write our DISC-0002 with AI Coding Manager as the main reference name and AICM as the short name. We DO use our methodology as software and I like that as a marketing tag so we hold onto that but we can think of something better as our main slogan, generate the new DISC-0002 content wording replacing the references like the screenshot I shared with a more AI Coding Manager focused slogan.

## Summary: DISC-0002 Rewritten with AI Coding Manager Branding

Successfully rewrote `@/Users/kalepook_ai/Coding/ai-coding-manager/.discussions/DISC-0002_AICM-Product-Definition.md:1-417` with:

### New Branding Structure

| Element | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Primary Name** | AICM | AI Coding Manager |
| **Short Form** | (implicit) | AICM |
| **Main Slogan** | "Methodology-as-Software" | **"From Chat to Code — With Full Provenance"** |
| **Secondary Tag** | - | *Methodology-as-Software* (kept as marketing tag) |

### Key Changes Made

1. **Title**: `# DISC-0002: AI Coding Manager — Product Definition & Strategic Roadmap`

2. **New Core Identity Section**:
   ```
   > "From Chat to Code — With Full Provenance"
   
   AI Coding Manager (AICM) is a framework that captures the complete 
   lifecycle of AI-assisted development — from the first conversation 
   to the final commit. Every line of code traces back to a human decision.
   
   *Methodology-as-Software* — We don't just describe best practices, 
   we encode them into the tools you use.
   ```

3. **Updated Tree of Thought Diagram**:
   ```
   ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
   │        AI CODING MANAGER            │
   │  "From Chat to Code — Full Provenance"  │
   └─────────────────────────────────────┘
   ```

4. **Renamed Tables**: "What AI Coding Manager Does" vs "What Others Do"

5. **Updated All Sections**: Q1-Q4, Child DISCs, Success Criteria, Conversation Log

6. **Session Notes**: Added SESSION_0018 documenting the rebrand

### The Slogan Hierarchy

- **Primary**: "From Chat to Code — With Full Provenance"
- **Secondary**: "Methodology-as-Software" (marketing tag for technical audiences)

### User Input

From here forward in this repo we will refer to all existing archived docs and the working code that is existing at this genesis will be marked v0 and all this code is certain to be modified in some way on our path to a full AICM Product. Please make a note in our main README and the DISC-0001 file

### Planner Response

## Summary: v0 Genesis Baseline Documented

Added v0 genesis notes to both files:

### `@/Users/kalepook_ai/Coding/ai-coding-manager/README.md:1-22`

- Updated tagline to **"From Chat to Code — With Full Provenance"**
- Changed status badge to `Genesis v0`
- Added new **⚠️ Genesis v0 Notice** section explaining:
  - Archived docs in `.archive/v0/` are preserved for reference
  - Working code is functional but subject to significant refactoring
  - Everything will be modified on the path to full product

### `@/Users/kalepook_ai/Coding/ai-coding-manager/.discussions/DISC-0001_Genesis-AICM-Vision.md:67-77`

- Added **v0 Baseline Definition** subsection under Decision:
  - Table showing archived artifacts, working code, and documentation status
  - Clear commitment statement: "All v0 code and documentation is certain to be modified on the path to a full AI Coding Manager product"

The lint warnings are pre-existing formatting issues in the files (table alignment, empty badge links), not caused by these edits.
