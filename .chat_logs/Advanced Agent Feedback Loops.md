### User Input

Please create a new DISC for the topic of discussing advanced AI AGENT FEEDBACK LOOPS that will discuss how we can use bottom-up documentation guided UAM model in our AICM, and also employ new top-down feed-back loop that will reorganize and refine the associated plans so that there is less friction, find inter-Plan schemes that can be employed to improve parallellism and improve time to prod (ttprod), other mult-agent techniques, and embed use of refined context or memory tools to improve outputs on the fly, built in debug that is easy to remove for automated testing and debugging by agent, etc. To employ this new method the full scope of development has to be addressed from outset and requires the highest level of rigor, and should have the strictest rules, and safeguards in place for when it comes time to execute this SUPER-PLAN

### Planner Response

I'll create a new Discussion document for Advanced AI Agent Feedback Loops. Let me first check the template and existing discussions to get the format and next number.

### Planner Response

The highest existing DISC is `DISC-0021`. I'll create `DISC-0022` for the Advanced AI Agent Feedback Loops topic.

### Planner Response

Created `@/home/mycahya/coding/ai-coding-manager/.discussions/DISC-0022_Advanced-AI-Agent-Feedback-Loops.md:1-376`.

## Summary

**DISC-0022** covers the following key topics you requested:

### Core Concepts
- **Bidirectional UAM Flow** - bottom-up documentation-guided + top-down plan refinement
- **Inter-Plan Parallelism Engine** - dependency graph analysis, friction detection, TTProd optimization
- **Context/Memory Refinement** - on-the-fly output improvement via RAG/vector stores
- **Agent-Removable Debug Instrumentation** - `@DEBUG_AGENT_REMOVABLE` marker pattern

### SUPER-PLAN Protocol
Four-phase execution with **mandatory human approval gates**:
1. Scope Lock
2. Validation  
3. Execution (with checkpoints)
4. Consolidation

### Safeguards
- 10-item checklist that MUST be completed before any SUPER-PLAN execution
- Fail-safe defaults (halt on ambiguity)
- Rollback capability requirement
- Complete audit trail

### Architecture Options
Recommended **Option C: Hierarchical Feedback with Gates** for maximum rigor.

The lint warnings are minor markdown styling differences (spacing around lists/tables) consistent with existing DISCs in the project—not blocking issues.
