# Cascade Chat Conversation

  Note: _This is purely the output of the chat conversation and does not contain any raw data, codebase snippets, etc. used to generate the output._

### User Input

Ok, our DOCs folder has kind of grown here. Can you please read each and every doc file and determine if the information is still current and relevant for the new full scope of the ADRS, Contracts, SPECs that we have solified as our codebases new foundation.

Please be careful and work slowly through all the doc files and determine their worth, please ask if there is ambiguity you need cleared up. I want a full report with actionable items for add/remove/delete actions. Then if no clarifying questions or ambiguity needs cleared up please execute the action list.

### Planner Response

I'll systematically audit all documentation files against your established ADRs, Contracts, and SPECs. Let me start by mapping out the docs folder structure and then reading each file.

## 🔴 Critical Issues

### 1. **DUPLICATE Tool Documentation Folders**
There are TWO folders for each tool with overlapping content:

| Duplicate Pair | Content Overlap |
|----------------|-----------------|
| `docs/dat/` vs `docs/data-aggregator/` | Both have DAT docs |
| `docs/pptx/` vs `docs/pptx-generator/` | Both have PPTX docs |
| `docs/sov/` vs `docs/sov-analyzer/` | Both have SOV docs |

**Recommendation:** Consolidate to ONE folder per tool.

### 2. **GAP_ANALYSIS Files Show 100% Complete But Are Historical**
Three gap analysis files claim 100% completion but are historical artifacts:
- `@c:/Users/Mycahya/CascadeProjects/engineering-tools/docs/GAP_ANALYSIS.md`
- `@c:/Users/Mycahya/CascadeProjects/engineering-tools/docs/dat/DAT_GAP_ANALYSIS.md`
- `@c:/Users/Mycahya/CascadeProjects/engineering-tools/docs/pptx/PPTX_GAP_ANALYSIS.md`
- `@c:/Users/Mycahya/CascadeProjects/engineering-tools/docs/sov/SOV_GAP_ANALYSIS.md`

**Recommendation:** Archive or delete - these served their purpose.

### 3. **change-plan/ Folder is a Planning Artifact**
The entire `change-plan/` directory (7 files) is **implementation planning documentation** that duplicates what's now in ADRs/SPECs:
- [PLATFORM_VISION.md](file:///c:/Users/Mycahya/CascadeProjects/engineering-tools/docs/change-plan/tier-1-vision/PLATFORM_VISION.md:0:0-0:0) → Covered by ADRs + SPEC_INDEX
- [CROSS_TOOL_INTEGRATION.md](file:///c:/Users/Mycahya/CascadeProjects/engineering-tools/docs/change-plan/tier-2-integration/CROSS_TOOL_INTEGRATION.md:0:0-0:0) → Covered by platform/DATASETS.md + PIPELINES.md
- [HOMEPAGE_CONTROL.md](file:///c:/Users/Mycahya/CascadeProjects/engineering-tools/docs/change-plan/tier-2-integration/HOMEPAGE_CONTROL.md:0:0-0:0) → Covered by ADR-0027
- Tool SPECs (DAT_SPEC.md, PPTX_SPEC.md, SOV_SPEC.md, HOMEPAGE_SPEC.md) → Covered by `docs/specs/`

**Recommendation:** Archive entire folder - planning phase is complete.

## 📋 Action Plan

### Phase 1: DELETE - Remove Obsolete Files (8 files)

| # | File | Reason |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | [docs/GAP_ANALYSIS.md](file:///c:/Users/Mycahya/CascadeProjects/engineering-tools/docs/GAP_ANALYSIS.md:0:0-0:0) | Historical artifact, 100% complete |

| 8 | Empty directories: `docs/dat/`, `docs/pptx/`, `docs/sov/` after deletions | Empty |

### Phase 2: ARCHIVE - Move Planning Docs (7 files)

Move entire `docs/change-plan/` to `docs/_archive/change-plan/`:
- [README.md](file:///c:/Users/Mycahya/CascadeProjects/engineering-tools/README.md:0:0-0:0)

## ❓ Clarifying Questions

Before I execute, please confirm:

1. **Delete vs Archive for GAP_ANALYSIS files?** These show valuable historical gap remediation. Should I:
   - **DELETE** them completely, or
   - **ARCHIVE** them to `docs/_archive/gap-analysis/`?

2. **Archive location for change-plan/?** Should I:
   - Move to `docs/_archive/change-plan/`, or
   - Delete entirely since ADRs/SPECs supersede it?

3. **Root-level DAT_CODE_REVIEW.md?** This is outside docs folder. Should I:
   - Delete it, or
   - Move to `docs/_archive/`?

**Please confirm your preferences and I'll execute all actions.**

### User Input

Please help me to develop some system for tracking the development work we are doing, is a changelog enough or is archival recommended, and if so what is the retention policy we should maintain? I think this may be another ADR on how we should treat the documentaion tracking, and overal strucure in a multi-project repo as we have with the complications that come with it. We should focus on first-principles approach and know that none of our current ADRs are full locked, and until we get through the development and switch over to production, and start having actual users, we can leave the ADRs as 'Accepted' but know they can be changed, and if changed they should revert to 'Proposed'

*Updated todo list*

### Planner Response

This is an excellent first-principles question. Let me think through this systematically and then draft an ADR that captures the decision.

## First-Principles Analysis

### The Problem Space

You have a **multi-project monorepo** in **active development** with:
- 4 tools (DAT, PPTX, SOV, Homepage)
- 29 ADRs, 22+ SPECs, 28+ Contracts
- Planning artifacts that served their purpose
- Gap analysis docs that tracked remediation
- No production users yet (development phase)

### Core Questions

| Question | First-Principles Answer |
|----------|-------------------------|
| **What is the purpose of tracking?** | Enable future-you (and collaborators) to understand *why* decisions were made and *what* changed |
| **Changelog vs Archive?** | **Both serve different purposes**: Changelog = "what changed", Archive = "what we tried/considered" |
| **Retention policy?** | Depends on document *type* - ADRs are forever, planning docs are ephemeral |
| **ADR mutability?** | During dev, ADRs are living documents; post-production they become immutable history |

### Document Lifecycle Categories

| Category | Purpose | Retention | Location |
|----------|---------|-----------|----------|
| **Tier 0: Contracts** | Source of truth | Forever (versioned) | `shared/contracts/` |
| **Tier 1: ADRs** | Decision rationale | Forever (superseded, not deleted) | [.adrs/](file:///c:/Users/Mycahya/CascadeProjects/engineering-tools/.adrs:0:0-0:0) |
| **Tier 2: SPECs** | Implementation specs | Forever (versioned) | `docs/specs/` |
| **Tier 3: Guides** | How-to content | Forever (updated in place) | [docs/](file:///c:/Users/Mycahya/CascadeProjects/engineering-tools/docs:0:0-0:0) |
| **Planning Docs** | Development planning | Archive after completion | `docs/_archive/` |
| **Gap Analysis** | Remediation tracking | Delete when complete | N/A |
| **Debug/Review Docs** | Ephemeral working docs | Delete when resolved | N/A |
| **CHANGELOG** | Release-level changes | Forever | `CHANGELOG.md` |

### ADR Lifecycle (Development Phase)

```
┌──────────┐     ┌──────────┐     ┌────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐
│ Proposed │ ──► │ Accepted │ ──► │ Superseded │ ──► │  Deprecated  │
│          │     │(mutable) │     │ (by newer) │     │ (legacy sys) │
└──────────┘     └──────────┘     └────────────┘     └──────────────┘
      ▲                │
      └────────────────┘
        If modified during dev
```

**Key insight**: In development, "Accepted" means "current team consensus" not "locked forever." If you change an Accepted ADR, it should cycle back to "Proposed" for re-review, then back to "Accepted."

---

Let me draft an ADR that captures this as **ADR-0030**:

*Viewed [ADR-0015_3-Tier-Document-Model.json](file:///c:/Users/Mycahya/CascadeProjects/engineering-tools/.adrs/core/ADR-0015_3-Tier-Document-Model.json) *

### Planner Response

Now let me create **ADR-0030** for Documentation Lifecycle Management. This will extend ADR-0015 with lifecycle, archival, and changelog policies:

*Edited relevant file*

*Edited relevant file*

*Edited relevant file*

*Viewed [CHANGELOG.md](file:///c:/Users/Mycahya/CascadeProjects/engineering-tools/CHANGELOG.md) *

*Edited relevant file*

### Planner Response

The MD024 warning (duplicate headings) is expected and correct for CHANGELOG files - multiple `### Added` sections for different versions is the standard format per keepachangelog.com.

Now let me update the ADR_INDEX.md to include ADR-0030:

*Viewed [ADR_INDEX.md](file:///c:/Users/Mycahya/CascadeProjects/engineering-tools/.adrs/ADR_INDEX.md) *

*Edited relevant file*

### Planner Response

The lint warnings in [ADR_INDEX.md](file:///c:/Users/Mycahya/CascadeProjects/engineering-tools/.adrs/ADR_INDEX.md:0:0-0:0) are pre-existing table formatting issues, not caused by my edit. I'll note them for later cleanup but won't address them now as they're cosmetic.

*Edited relevant file*

*Updated todo list*

### Planner Response

# Summary: Documentation Tracking System

## ✅ Created

### 1. ADR-0030: Documentation Lifecycle Management
`@c:/Users/Mycahya/CascadeProjects/engineering-tools/.adrs/core/ADR-0030_Documentation-Lifecycle-Management.json`

**Key decisions:**
- **5 document categories** with distinct retention policies:
  - Tier 0-3 (Contracts/ADRs/SPECs/Guides) = **Forever** (versioned)
  - Ephemeral working docs = **Delete or Archive**

- **ADR lifecycle during development:**
  - "Accepted" = current consensus, **mutable** until production
  - Material changes → revert to "Proposed" for re-review
  - All changes → add provenance entry
  - Post-production → ADRs become **immutable**

- **Archival policy:**
  - Archive to `docs/_archive/{category}/{date}/`
  - Include README explaining archive reason
  - Indefinite retention (storage is cheap)

- **CHANGELOG policy:**
  - Keep a Changelog format at repo root
  - Release-level granularity
  - Semver versioning (0.x.y during dev)

## 📋 Next Steps: Execute Doc Cleanup

Per ADR-0030, I'm ready to execute the cleanup. Based on the ADR's policies:

| Action | Files | Per ADR-0030 Category |
|--------|-------|----------------------|
| **DELETE** | 4 gap analysis files, 2 debug docs, 1 root-level code review | Ephemeral (purpose fulfilled) |
| **ARCHIVE** | 7 change-plan files | Planning (historically significant) |
| **DELETE** | 3 empty folders (docs/dat/, docs/pptx/, docs/sov/) | Duplicates |

**Shall I proceed with execution?** 

If yes, I'll:
1. Create `docs/_archive/planning/2025-12/` and move change-plan/ files
2. Delete ephemeral docs (gap analyses, debug docs)
3. Delete duplicate empty folders
4. Update stale content in 5 files (fix broken links, roadmaps)

docs(adr): establish documentation lifecycle management with archival policy

This commit implements ADR-0030 (Documentation Lifecycle Management) and executes
a comprehensive documentation audit and cleanup of the engineering-tools monorepo.

## Changes

### New ADR & Changelog
- docs(adr): ADR-0030 - Documentation Lifecycle Management for Multi-Project Monorepo
  * Defines 5-category document classification (Tier 0-3 + ephemeral)
  * Establishes archival policy: docs/_archive/{category}/{date}/
  * Introduces development-phase ADR mutability (Accepted → mutable until production)
  * Material ADR changes revert to "Proposed" for re-review
  * All changes require provenance entry
  * Implements CHANGELOG.md for release-level tracking (Keep a Changelog format)
  * Semver versioning: 0.x.y during development, 1.0.0+ in production

- docs(changelog): CHANGELOG.md - Release-level change tracking
  * Initial 0.1.0 release documenting all platform features
  * Tracks 29 ADRs, 22+ SPECs, 28+ Contracts
  * Lists core infrastructure, tool implementations, and acceptance criteria

### Deleted (8,177 lines removed)

## ADR Status

Total ADRs: 30 (including new ADR-0030)
- Core: 14 ADRs (foundational patterns)
- DAT: 8 ADRs (tool-specific)
- PPTX: 4 ADRs (tool-specific)
- SOV: 3 ADRs (tool-specific)
- DevTools: 1 ADR (tool-specific)

All ADRs marked "Accepted" with development-phase mutability per ADR-0030.

## Rationale

Per first-principles analysis:
- **Changelog vs Archive:** Both serve distinct purposes (release tracking vs context preservation)
- **Retention Policy:** Tier 0-3 docs forever (versioned), ephemeral docs archived/deleted
- **ADR Mutability:** Development phase requires flexibility; immutability comes with production
- **Multi-Project Structure:** Single doc folder per tool prevents duplication and confusion

This cleanup establishes a sustainable documentation system aligned with ADR-0015
(3-Tier Document Model) and ADR-0030 (Lifecycle Management).

## Testing

- [x] Archive directory created with manifest
- [x] All ephemeral docs deleted
- [x] Duplicate folders removed
- [x] Stale content updated in remaining docs
- [x] ADR_INDEX.md updated with ADR-0030
- [x] CHANGELOG.md created with 0.1.0 release
